# OS-Labs

For this lab we created a program able to get the product of to matrixes using threads to make the operation faster. When compiling the command "gcc multiplier.c -o multiplier.o -l pthread" must be used, and when running the number of desired buffers must be specified next to the main command "./multiplier.o 2". Verify that the desired .dat files are located within the same direcory as the code when attempting to run.

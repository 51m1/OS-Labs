For lab 7.1 run both server1 and client1. Compile like normal (no need for special libraries) and run the server in the background with the command "./server1.o&", then run the client using the following syntax: "./client1 <r,m,s> [v1 v2 ...]".

For lab7.2 use server3 and client3. Compile like normal. Run server in bacground with the same command "./server3.o&", then you may run multiple clients using the following syntax: "./client1 <clientid>".

After tests are finished kill the server process using the kill command: "kill <processid>".
